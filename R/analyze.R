### Analyze Water Quality Data


## List of files for each category (eventlab, temperature, etc)



## read.csv (only numeric data) -> dataset for each category (ignore 'other' vars)

## Attach variables vertically

## Eventlab vars: convert from numeric to factor (normal/alarm)

## Aggregate per hour



## Heatmaps (al least for eventlab, possibly for other categories)

## Dendrogram (related vars within categories)

## Multivariate plots (for multiple categories)


## Select 1 response var

## Select 1 interesting dataset with predictors (for example turbidity)

## Select interesting time range (maybe not necessary)

## Merge predictor set and response var

## Remove rows with NA (consider these as clean datasets that we can work with)


## Split into train and test sets

## Apply ML algorithm (RF, GBM, Tree)

## Predict and validate

## Check list of important predictors
